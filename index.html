<p>When art meets the blockchain, what kind of sparks will it create?</p>
<p>At the moment, a dazzling spark is Non-Fungible Token (NFT). There are many kinds of Chinese translation, for example, non-homogeneous tokens, non-fungible tokens, and non-homogeneous tokens. I tend to use the translation of &quot;non-homogeneous tokens&quot; because the concept of &quot;tokens&quot; is too narrow to cover many applications of the blockchain, and the interpretation of &quot;tokens&quot; can be broader.</p>
<br/>
<p>However, in most occasions, I still use the English abbreviation NFT for conciseness and fluency.</p>
<br/>
<p>&quot;Non-Homogeneous Token&quot; (NFT) is a unique digital asset whose ownership can be recorded and managed through the blockchain. These digital assets are the application scenarios of NFT, including, for example, digital art, various collectibles, electronic game props, event tickets, domain names, and even ownership records of physical assets.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you have been swimming in the world of Bitcoin, blockchain, or &quot;encryption&quot; in a broad sense for some time, then you may have heard of NFT. The NFT ecosystem is a close team of passionate innovators: from enthusiasts to developers to gamers, from entrepreneurs to artists.</p>
<br/>
<p>For blockchain and its various applications, maybe you are a skeptic, a believer, or maybe you still don&apos;t know what NFT is. In any case, my &quot;NFT Introduction&quot; series of articles will bring you a concise and comprehensive knowledge of NFT, including an in-depth overview of NFT, technical analysis of ERC721, the history of NFT, common misunderstandings about NFT, and the NFT market status quo.</p>
<br/>
<p>What is &quot;Non-Homogeneous Token&quot; (NFT)?</p>
<p>To understand NFT, we must start with the concept of &quot;mutable replacement&quot;. The so-called &quot;mutually replaceable&quot; means &quot;to be able to replace or be replaced by another identical item&quot;.</p>
<br/>
<p>&quot;Homogeneity&quot; means that they can be replaced by each other; &quot;non-homogeneity&quot; means that they cannot be replaced by each other. If you think this is too abstract, the following example will quickly clarify the concept.</p>
<br/>
<p>Currency is a typical homogenized asset, that is, it can be replaced with each other. Five yuan is five yuan. No matter whether the serial number on the five-yuan bill is different from the five-yuan bill, or whether this is a five-yuan bill and the other is the five-yuan bill in the bank account, they can all be replaced with each other. . You can even replace a five-yuan bill with five one-yuan bills.</p>
<br/>
<p>There is a dialogue in the TV series &quot;Latent&quot;, which jokingly utters the essence of &quot;homogenization&quot;: &quot;Now two gold bars are placed here. Tell me which one is noble and which one is nasty.&quot; It is &quot;homogenization&quot;, there is no distinction between high and low.</p>
<br/>
<p>However, you may not realize that most of our daily life items are non-homogeneous, and homogenous assets such as currency are actually rare. Just think about most of the things you own, the chair you sit on, your phone, your laptop, any second-hand items you want to sell. All of these belong to the category of non-homogeneous items.</p>
<br/>
<p>Please note that &quot;homogenization&quot; is relative. For example, for business class, economy class and first class tickets, each ticket can be roughly interchanged with tickets of the same class, that is, tickets of the same class are roughly of the same quality. However, you cannot exchange economy class tickets for business class tickets, so tickets of different classes are non-homogeneous. For another example, the chair you are sitting on can roughly be interchanged with a chair of the same brand model, so the chair of the same brand model is roughly the same. However, if you have a special attachment to your own chair, even another chair of the same brand and model cannot be interchanged with your chair, so they are non-homogeneous.</p>
<br/>
<p>Please also note that &quot;homogenization&quot; can also be subjective. Returning to the example of air tickets: a person who likes a window seat and a person who wants an aisle seat would not think that a window ticket can be exchanged with an aisle seat, even if both tickets are in economy class. Similarly, a rare one-cent coin may be worth a penny to me, but it may be valuable to a coin collector. We will see that these subtle differences become very important when representing these projects on the blockchain.</p>
<br/>
<p>Blockchain-based NFT</p>
<p>Digital currencies or digital tokens are nothing new. Before the emergence of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, we had a variety of digital currencies (tokens). You only need to think about airline miles, hotel points, and tokens in computer games.</p>
<br/>
<p>Similarly, digital assets have a long history. Since the advent of the Internet, we have had non-homogeneous digital assets. Domain names, event tickets, in-game props, and even usernames on social networks such as WeChat and Weibo are all irreplaceable digital assets. They differ only in terms of tradability, liquidity, and interoperability.</p>
<br/>
<p>Digital assets can be very valuable. EPIC Game Company, in its free game &quot;Fortnite&quot;, in 2018 alone, through the sale of virtual costume props, revenue reached 2.4 billion US dollars. The event ticket market is expected to reach US$68 billion in 2025, and the domain name market continues to grow steadily. These are all examples of digital assets bringing high value.</p>
<br/>
<p>Although we have a large number of digital assets, we have never really &quot;owned&quot; these assets.</p>
<br/>
<p>Even though we already have a large number of digital products, to what extent do we &quot;own&quot; these digital products? Imagine that you create a picture or emoticon package and share it on the Internet. As a result, anyone can copy it freely. How can you easily and credibly prove your ownership to others? Another attribute of asset ownership is that it can be bought and sold freely, but for digital assets, this is not easy. If you try to sell a Fortnite game skin on eBay, you will find that transferring digital assets from one person to another is actually quite difficult or inconvenient.</p>
<br/>
<p>This is where the blockchain comes in! Blockchain provides a coordination layer for digital assets, which not only allows users to easily and credibly prove their ownership of digital assets, but also makes digital asset transactions more free, credible and reliable. Blockchain adds some unique attributes to non-homogeneous assets, and these attributes change the relationship between users and developers and these assets. Because of this, as one of the application scenarios of NFT, &quot;crypto art&quot; turned out to be a great innovation and subversion in the traditional art world.</p>
<br/>
<p>Next notice: My next NFT introduction article may be quite &quot;technical&quot;, involving what unique attributes the blockchain adds to non-homogeneous assets. Although &quot;technical&quot;, it is necessary and important for readers who want to understand and use NFT in depth.</p>
